Personal configuration files
==============================

A set of my configuration files, very useful for all my computers.

This directory contains subdirectories and files that should be inside my *home* directory. It could be useful to create *symlinks* to them.

Directories:

* **.config**: Configuration files for X. */etc/xdg/* is the system-wide equivalent of *~/.config/* for applications that comply with the freedesktop standards.
* **.vim**: Config. files for Vim editor
* **.xmonad**: Config. files for XMonad window manager
* **scripts**: Useful bash scripts.
